# sports_timer_v5

Hello,

This is a project I made using JS, ReactJS and HTML/CSS. 

A timer for workouts in which you can add custom exercises. 

Features:
  - 3 second audio countdown before workout begins
  - 3 second audio countdown before individual exercise ends 
  - exercise names are spoken via text-to-speech
  - can save/load a workout to a .json file 
  
The app is hosted by github pages at https://soringherghisan.github.io/sports_timer_v5/
